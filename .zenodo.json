  "title": "PRESTO: Privacy REcommendation and SecuriTy Optimization",
  "description": "A Python package that provides intelligent recommendations for optimal differential privacy algorithms based on user preferences and dataset characteristics. PRESTO uses Bayesian optimization to automatically determine the best privacy preservation algorithm, privacy loss parameters, confidence intervals, and reliability scores for a given dataset.",
