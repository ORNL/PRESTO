  abstract: >-
  PRESTO (Privacy REcommendation and SecuriTy Optimization) is a Python-based
  toolkit that automates the selection of differential-privacy mechanisms to
  balance data utility and privacy loss. By integrating descriptive and
  inferential statistics, Bayesian optimization, and data-similarity metrics,
  PRESTO analyzes arbitrary datasets and recommends the optimal privacy
  algorithm and Îµ-parameter setting with quantified uncertainty. Version 2.0.4
  introduces comprehensive medical privacy specialization with support for
  healthcare, genomics, and clinical trial data, including HIPAA compliance
  features and specialized tutorials for medical privacy scenarios.
